A voice transcript made during the collection, as well as a more detailed discussion of the lunar environment can be found in Geological Survey Professional Paper 880 (Swann et al., 1977). The sample was returned in bag 1038. This large sample is typical of the apparently dominent rock type in the Cone Crater ejecta blanket. It is a moderately well-indurated breccia, in which predominately dark clasts are set in a lighter matrix. The relative abundance of this rock type suggests that it is probalby representative of the Fra Mauro Formation. This rock, 14321, is a partly annealed, moderately coherent polymict breccia. The blocky surface is gray with patches of black and white."
